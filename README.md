# Kris-Kringle App

This is an app for Kris-Kringles, Secret Santas, whatever you want to call them -- events where you write lists of things you want and then randomize so each person gets someone else's list.

This is implemented in Rust using [Diana](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/diana) for the serverless GraphQL backend, and [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) is used for the frontend.
